# Slaughterfield-AD

Slaughterfield A/D gamemode. Created for the s7 clan (sigmaseven.forumfree.it) but it's not used since we don't play SAMP anymore. It was one of my first "big" projects and I didn't know how to use Git or how to write good code, but i'm still proud of the GM after all. Uses MySQL to read data if I recover a dump I will add it

I decided to share it to don't let it die in a folder and because I loved create it :) It's not the best example of "good" "clean" "efficient" code but aannnyywway
