# Slaughterfield-AD

Slaughterfield A/D gamemode. Created for the s7 clan (sigmaseven.forumfree.it) but it's not used since we don't play SAMP anymore. It was one of my first "big" projects and I didn't know how to use Git or how to write good code, but i'm still proud of the GM after all. Uses MySQL to read data if I recover a dump I will add it

I decided to share it to don't let it die in a folder and because I loved create it :) It's not the best example of "good" "clean" "efficient" code but aannnyywway

You can play any mode:

- A/D (Everything or Interiors only)
- Area
- TDM
- Player vs Player
- Gungame
- Fight "All vs All" or "One Vs One"
- Fallout
- Last bullet

Some features:

- ESL mode
- Voting system
- Editor for bases/arene/etc. (create new or edit existing)
- End round textdraw that allows you to see the textdraw of previous rounds
- TCW/CW support
- Upload of matches online
- Bases pack concept (So in ESL mode you can use ESL basepack and in other modes the normal basepack)
- Auto round in Fun mode so no admins or votation needed. Everything is automatic.
- Customize your player by adding objects (Yes, you can save them and you will get them back your next login)
- Beta login based on Hardware ID
- Most commands merge things together (like, /add [all|ball|id] instead of three different commands) and provide fast way to access them, like /aa or /ab

There is a ESL mode and a voting system.

The final TextDraw of every round will let you see the results of the previous rounds.


The last comment "And this is the end of the best existing A/D GM. Stay hungry, stay foolish!" has been aded by Miki after he translated the entire gamemode to English. Thank you <3
